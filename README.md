# NfvFhe

**NfvFhe** is a privacy-preserving solution for **Network Function Virtualization (NFV)**, leveraging **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to manage and orchestrate Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) securely. It ensures that sensitive configuration and operational state data remain encrypted while still allowing automated management and verification.

---

## Project Background

Modern telecommunication networks rely on NFV to provide flexible, scalable network services. However, NFV introduces several security challenges:

- **Sensitive VNF configurations** may be exposed to unauthorized actors.  
- **Dynamic orchestration** requires frequent state updates, creating attack surfaces.  
- **Trust assumptions** between management systems and VNFs are often weak.  
- **Regulatory compliance** demands confidentiality for certain network operations.  

**NfvFhe addresses these issues** by enabling encrypted VNF configuration, state monitoring, and orchestration, ensuring that network operators can manage services without exposing critical internal details.

## Core Concepts

- **Encrypted VNF Configuration:** All network function settings are encrypted end-to-end.  
- **Encrypted State Monitoring:** VNFs report operational state in ciphertext form, protecting sensitive metrics.  
- **Secure Orchestration:** FHE allows orchestration algorithms to execute on encrypted data, validating deployments, updates, and scaling securely.  
- **Immutable Verification:** Operations are provably valid without revealing the underlying network secrets.

## Features

### NFV Management

- **VNF Deployment:** Encrypted configuration and state ensure that VNFs are securely instantiated.  
- **Service Chaining:** FHE-enabled chaining of VNFs preserves privacy of individual function details.  
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Collect telemetry and performance metrics in encrypted form.  
- **Automated Scaling:** Orchestrate resource allocation without exposing operational logic.

### Security & Privacy

- **Encrypted Configuration Storage:** VNF setup files, credentials, and policies remain confidential.  
- **Encrypted State Analysis:** Network health checks and anomaly detection operate on encrypted data.  
- **Tamper Resistance:** Ensures integrity of VNF configuration and orchestration actions.  
- **Policy Compliance:** Meets regulatory requirements for confidential network data handling.

### Network Assurance

- **Provable Actions:** All orchestration steps are verifiable using encrypted computation.  
- **Zero Knowledge Updates:** Network controllers can validate actions without decrypting sensitive data.  
- **Resilient to Insider Threats:** Administrators cannot access sensitive configuration or state directly.
